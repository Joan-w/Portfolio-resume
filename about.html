            <p><b>Hello,</b><br>
                My name is <b>Joan Wamuyu Kinyua</b>.<br>
                I am a Software Engineering graduate from Moringa School,
                I actually graduated not so long ago....</p>
                <p>I took a programming course because I like to solve problems and programming<br>
                is the technique that I like the most. The reasons are as follows:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>it requires less resources than other strategies, methods, techniques etc...<br>
                        To develop an electronic circuit, you need more resources. If you want to<br>
                        build something, you need even more resources. If you want to do some mechanical<br>
                        construction, it requires even further resources.</li>
                    <li>you can do vastly more interesting things with programming and, nowadays, reach<br>
                        a larger audience with it</li>
                    <li>it is more malleable and less wasteful if you do something wrong, you only waste your time</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>While I learn programming, the infrastructure has changed dramatically. It has been real fun to be part of this.</p>
            <p>My hobbies and interests are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dancing</li>
                    <li>Computing</li>
                    <li>Watching movies</li>
                    <li>Reading novels</li>
                    <li>Road trips</li>
                    <li>Photography</li>
                    <li>Volunteering</li>
                    <li>Cleaning</li>
                    <li>Listening to music etc......</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Some of my skills are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Active listening</li>
                    <li>Adaptibility</li>
                    <li>Creativity</li>
                    <li>Decision making</li>
                    <li>Leadership</li>
                    <li>Public speaking</li>
                </ul>
