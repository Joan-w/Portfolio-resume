            <p><b>Hello,</b><br>
                My name is <b>Joan Wamuyu Kinyua</b>.<br>
                I am a Software Engineering graduate from Moringa School,<br>
                I actually graduated not so long ago....<br>
                I completed highschool in 2019 and immediately joined Moringa School<br>
                since was the perfect place for me to make my dream i.e being a<br>
                a Software Engineer come true and finally it did. With the skill I have acquired<br>
                in Moringa I plan to use them in solving problems mainly faced by the community<br>
                and hopefully make their lives much easier.</p>
                <p>I took a programming course because I like to solve problems and programming<br>
                is the technique that I like the most. The reasons are as follows:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>it require less resources than other strategies, methods, techniques etc...<br>
                        To develop an electronic circuit, you need more resources. If you want to<br>
                        build something, you need even more resources. If you want to do some mechanical<br>
                        construction, it requires even further resources.</li>
                    <li>you can do vastly more interesting things with programming and, nowadays, reach<br>
                        a larger audience with it</li>
                    <li>it is more malleable and less wasteful if you do something wrong, you only waste your time</li>
                </ul>
                While I learn programming, the infrastructure has changed dramatically. It has been real fun to be part of this.
            </p>
            <p>My hobbies and interests are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dancing</li>
                    <li>Computing</li>
                    <li>Watching movies</li>
                    <li>Reading novels</li>
                    <li>Road trips</li>
                    <li>Photography</li>
                    <li>Volunteering</li>
                    <li>Cleaning</li>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                </ul>
                etc.......
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Active listening</li>
