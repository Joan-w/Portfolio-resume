## Description
The portfolio entails my background information, my hobbies/interests and skills and the naumber of the projects I have done. Basically it contains information about myself.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* When one opens any browser and types in the portfolio the first thing you see is the landing page which contains my picture, my name and what I do.
* From the homepage there is a side navigation bar which one needs to hover around it for ine to be able to navigate to any page of their choice.
* The first page one likely navigates to is the about page which now is made of my information and hobbies and skills.
* The second page one likely navigates to is the projects page which contains a number of projects I have done with examples.
* The last page is the contacts page which contains a form where one can leave any message for me and most preferably a message of us working together.
* All pages contain a footer which has my social media handles where you contact me through.
One needs data bundles to access the portfolio.
## Technologies Used
* I used HTML to make the structure of the website.
* I used CSS to style the website.
* I used CSS3 to add frameworks to the website.
